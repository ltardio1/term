**Dead End Brooklyn**
(alt titles: Terminal Prompt / Happy Endings )


A mobile-friendly application to share geo-tagged pictures at specific dead end streets
in Brooklyn.  Users will be given directions from their location to the nearest verified dead-end.
Once at the dead-end users can either post pictures / comments, or be given a few preset options (ie: leaving initials w/ photo "J.D. was here")

Dead end Brooklyn will use the goolgle maps API and perhaps chrome geolocation object we looked at in class.



**USER STORY**


As a guest  i should be able to view a map of all listed dead ends

As a guest i should be able to view user posts and pictures

*As a user i should be able to create an account

*As a user i should be able to create a post a comment having reached a dead end

*As a user i should be able to take a picture and include it in my post

As a user i should be able to get directions to the nearest dead end street

As a user i should be able to easily grasp what the application does

(*MVP)

**other thoughts**

Perhaps the look and feel of the website can mimic a terminal prompt
A later version may give the user the option to create their own dead ends
-- verification of dead end would require a sum total of users (10+) to become active
